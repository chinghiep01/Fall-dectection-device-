# Fall detection device 

## Introduction: 
### Background: 
Accidental falls are dangerous for elderly people  and could cause injuries that involve hospitalisation or death. To minimise the the hospitalisation and death,further imporove the wellbeing , fall detector enable carer to rescue elderly people in the shotest time interval. 

### Aim:
+ To design a fall detector to detect the fall of human over 50 in 6 axis. 
+ The design should contain thermometer to measure body temperature.
+ The system need scurity password to ensure privacy. 

## Component: 
+ MPU-6050 6-Axis (Gyro + Accelerometer)
+ SSD1306 OLED display
+ Arduino Mega microcontroller
+ Analog Temperature Sensor 
+ PushButton 

## Result :

## Code Explanation : 

#### Time interrupt :  
#### Analog Interrupt :

#### Hardware Interrupt: 
#### Mathmatical for fall detect:
